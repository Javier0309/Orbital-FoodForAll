          At <strong>FoodForAll</strong>, we are dedicated to fighting hunger and reducing food waste by connecting food and beverage (F&amp;B) businesses with underprivileged families in need. 
          Our platform provides a simple, efficient way for restaurants, cafes, and other F&amp;B establishments to donate their surplus food, ensuring that delicious meals reach those who need them most.<br /><br />
          By fostering a community of generosity and sustainability, we aim to create a future where no good food goes to waste, and every family has access to nourishing meals. 
          <br /><br />
